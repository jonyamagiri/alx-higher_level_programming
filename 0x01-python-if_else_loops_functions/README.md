## 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

> This repository contains the tasks for `Python - if/else, loops, functions` project and a description of what each program or function does:

### Tasks

#### Task: 0-positive_or_negative.py
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the [source code](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/rkvoXPA-lS3TAaemM9sChg) in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.

#### Task: 1-last_digit.py
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the [source code](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/hU682hcMxVchqWAcmh32tA) in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.

#### Task: 2-print_alphabet.py
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

#### Task: 3-print_alphabt.py
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

#### Task: 4-print_hexa.py
Write a program that prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal

#### Task: 5-print_comb2.py
Write a program that prints numbers from `0` to `99`

#### Task: 6-print_comb3.py
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits

#### Task: 7-islower.py
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

#### Task: 8-uppercase.py
Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

#### Task: 9-print_last_digit.py
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

#### Task: 10-add.py
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

#### Task: 11-pow.py
Write a function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and return the value.

#### Task: 12-fizzbuzz.py
Write a function that prints the numbers from `1` to `100` separated by a space.
* For multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for multiples of five print `Buzz`.
* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.

#### Task: 13-insert_number.c, lists.h
**Technical interview prep:** 
Write a function in `C` that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
* Prototype: `listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number);`
* Return: the address of the new node, or `NULL` if it failed

#### Task: 100-print_tebahpla.py
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (`z` in lowercase and `Y` in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.

#### Task: 101-remove_char_at.py
Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position `n` (not the Python way, the “C array index”).

#### Task: 102-magic_calculation.py
Write the Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b, c):` that does exactly the same as the provided Python bytecode:

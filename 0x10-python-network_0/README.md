> This repository contains the tasks for `Python - Network #0` project and a description of what each program or function does:

### Learning Objectives

* What a URL is
* What HTTP is
* How to read a URL
* The scheme for a HTTP URL
* What a domain name is
* What a sub-domain is
* How to define a port number in a URL
* What a query string is
* What an HTTP request is
* What an HTTP response is
* What HTTP headers are
* What the HTTP message body is
* What an HTTP request method is
* What an HTTP response status code is
* What an HTTP Cookie is
* How to make a request with cURL
* What happens when you type google.com in your browser (Application level)


### Tasks

#### Task: 0-body_size.sh
Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a request to that URL, and displays the size of the body of the response
* The size must be displayed in bytes
* You have to use `curl`

#### Task: 1-body.sh
Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a `GET` request to the URL, and displays the body of the response
* Display only body of a `200` status code response
* You have to use `curl`

#### Task: 2-delete.sh
Write a Bash script that sends a `DELETE` request to the URL passed as the first argument and displays the body of the response
* You have to use `curl`

#### Task: 3-methods.sh
Write a Bash script that takes in a URL and displays all HTTP methods the server will accept.
* You have to use `curl`

#### Task: 4-header.sh
Write a Bash script that takes in a URL as an argument, sends a `GET` request to the URL, and displays the body of the response
* A header variable `X-School-User-Id` must be sent with the value `98`
* You have to use `curl`

#### Task: 5-post_params.sh
Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a `POST` request to the passed URL, and displays the body of the response
* A variable `email` must be sent with the value `test@gmail.com`
* A variable `subject` must be sent with the value `I will always be here for PLD`
* You have to use `curl`

#### Task: 6-peak.py, 6-peak.txt
**Technical interview prep:** 
Write a function that finds a **peak** in a list of unsorted integers.
* Prototype: `def find_peak(list_of_integers):`
* You are not allowed to import any module
* Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity (hint: you donâ€™t need to go through all numbers to find a peak)
* `6-peak.py` must contain the function
* `6-peak.txt` must contain the complexity of your algorithm: `O(log(n))`, `O(n)`, `O(nlog(n))` or `O(n2)`
* Note: there may be more than one peak in the list

#### Task: 100-status_code.sh
Write a Bash script that sends a request to a URL passed as an argument, and displays only the status code of the response.
* You are not allowed to use any pipe, redirection, etc.
* You are not allowed to use `;` and `&&`
* You have to use `curl`

#### Task: 101-post_json.sh
Write a Bash script that sends a JSON `POST` request to a URL passed as the first argument, and displays the body of the response.
* Your script must send a `POST` request with the contents of a file, passed with the filename as the second argument of the script, in the body of the request
* You have to use `curl`

#### Task: 
Write a Bash script that makes a request to `0.0.0.0:5000/catch_me` that causes the server to respond with a message containing `You got me!`, in the body of the response.
* You have to use `curl`
You are not allow to use `echo`, `cat`, etc. to display the final result

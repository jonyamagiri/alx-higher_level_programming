## 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

> This repository contains the tasks for `JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures` project and a description of what each program or function does:

### Learning Objectives

* Why JavaScript programming is amazing
* How to create an object in JavaScript
* What `this` means
* What `undefined` means
* Why the variable type and scope is important
* What is a closure
* What is a prototype
* How to inherit an object from another

### Tasks

#### Task: 0-rectangle.js
Write an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle:
* You must use the `class` notation for defining your class

#### Task: 1-rectangle.js
Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle:
* You must use the `class` notation for defining your class. The constructor must take 2 arguments `w` and `h`. Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`. Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`

#### Task: 2-rectangle.js
Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle:
* You must use the `class` notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments `w` and `h`. Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`. Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`. If `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object

#### Task: 3-rectangle.js
Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle:
* You must use the `class` notation for defining your class. The constructor must take 2 arguments: `w` and `h`. Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`. Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`. If `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object. Create an instance method called `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character `X`

#### Task: 4-rectangle.js
Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle:
* You must use the `class` notation for defining your class. The constructor must take 2 arguments: `w` and `h`. Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`. Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`. If `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object. Create an instance method called `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character `X`. Create an instance method called `rotate()` that exchanges the `width` and the `height` of the rectangle. Create an instance method called `double()` that multiples the `width` and the `height` of the rectangle by 2

#### Task: 5-square.js
Write a class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Rectangle` of `4-rectangle.js`:
* You must use the `class` notation for defining your class and `extends`. The constructor must take 1 argument: `size`. The constructor of `Rectangle` must be called (by using `super()`)

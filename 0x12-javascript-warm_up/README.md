## 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

> This repository contains the tasks for `JavaScript - Warm up` project and a description of what each program or function does:

### Learning Objectives

* Why JavaScript programming is amazing
* How to run a JavaScript script
* How to create variables and constants
* What are differences between `var`, `const` and `let`
* What are all the data types available in JavaScript
* How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
* How to use comments
* How to affect values to variables
* How to use `while` and `for` loops
* How to use `break` and `continue` statements
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What does a function that does not use any `return` statement return
* Scope of variables
* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
* How to manipulate dictionary
* How to import a file

### Tasks

#### Task: 0-javascript_is_amazing.js
Write a script that prints “JavaScript is amazing”:
* You must create a constant variable called `myVar` with the value “JavaScript is amazing”. You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output. You are not allowed to use `var`

#### Task: 1-multi_languages.js
Write a script that prints 3 lines:
* The first line: “C is fun”. The second line: “Python is cool”. The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”. You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output. You are not allowed to use `var`

#### Task: 2-arguments.js
Write a script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed:
* If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”. If only one argument is passed to the script, print “Argument found”. Otherwise, print “Arguments found”. You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output. You are not allowed to use `var`

#### Task: 3-value_argument.js
Write a script that prints the first argument passed to it:
* If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”. You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output. You are not allowed to use `var`. You are not allowed to use `length`

#### Task: 4-concat.js
Write a script that prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: “ is ”
* You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output. You are not allowed to use `var`

#### Task: 5-to_integer.js
Write a script that prints `My number: <first argument converted in integer>` if the first argument can be converted to an integer:
* If the argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Not a number”. You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output. You are not allowed to use `var`. You are not allowed to use `try/catch`

#### Task: 6-multi_languages_loop.js
Write a script that prints 3 lines: (like `1-multi_languages.js`) but by using an array of string and a loop
* The first line: “C is fun”. The second line: “Python is cool”. The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”. You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output. You are not allowed to use `var`. You are not allowed to use any `if/else` statement. You can use only one `console.log`. You must use a loop (`while`, `for`, etc.)

#### Task: 7-multi_c.js
Write a script that prints `x` times “C is fun”
* Where `x` is the first argument of the script. If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing number of occurrences”. You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output. You are not allowed to use `var`. You can use only two `console.log`. You must use a loop (`while`, `for`, etc.).

#### Task: 8-square.js
Write a script that prints a square
* The first argument is the size of the square. If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing size”. You must use the character `X` to print the square. You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output. You are not allowed to use `var`. You must use a loop (`while`, `for`, etc.)

#### Task: 9-add.js
Write a script that prints the addition of 2 integers
* The first argument is the first integer. The second argument is the second integer. You have to define a function with this prototype: `function add(a, b)`. You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output. You are not allowed to use `var`

#### Task: 10-factorial.js
Write a script that computes and prints a factorial
* The first argument is integer (argument can be cast as integer) used for computing the factorial. Factorial of `NaN` is `1`. You must do it recursively. You must use a function. You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output. You are not allowed to use `var`

#### Task: 11-second_biggest.js
Write a script that searches the second biggest integer in the list of arguments.
* You can assume all arguments can be converted to integer. If no argument passed, print `0`. If the number of arguments is 1, print `0`. You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output. You are not allowed to use `var`

#### Task: 12-object.js
Update this script to replace the value `12` with `89`:
* You are not allowed to use `var`

#### Task: 13-add.js
Write a function that returns the addition of 2 integers.
* The function must be visible from outside. The name of the function must be `add`. You are not allowed to use `var`

#### Task: 100-let_me_const.js
Write a file that modifies the value of `myVar` to `333`

#### Task: 101-call_me_moby.js
Write a function that executes `x` times a function.
* The function must be visible from outside. Prototype: `function (x, theFunction)`. You are not allowed to use `var`

#### Task: 102-add_me_maybe.js
Write a function that increments and calls a function.
* The function must be visible from outside. Prototype: `function (number, theFunction)`. You are not allowed to use `var`

#### Task: 103-object_fct.js
Update this script by adding a new function `incr` that increments the integer `value`.
* You are not allowed to use `var`
